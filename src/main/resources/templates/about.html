		<p>Books are our favourite way and what is better than to have a
			conversation with similar minded people. Sharing knowledge through
			questions and answers helps us understand how each of us can affect
			change in a positive way. The Book Club meets monthly where we invite
			an author to showcase their book and share their knowledge. Through
			conversations with the author, we grow our capability by
			understanding how we can change our environments.</p>
